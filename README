-=Basic Usage Examples=-

A simple example of how to use PulledPork would be to specify all of your configuration directives inside of the
PulledPork.conf file.  Specifically for minimal function, i.e. NO Shared Object rule processing you must define 
at a minimum the rule_file, oinkcode, temp_path, tar_path, and rule_path values.  Below are some examples of this. 

./pulledpork.pl -o /usr/local/etc/snort/rules/ -O 12345667778523452344234234  \
-u http://www.snort.org/reg-rules/snortrules-snapshot-2860.tar.gz -i disablesid.conf -T -H

The above will fetch the snortrules-snapshot-2860.tar.gz tarball from snort.org using the specified oinkcode of 
12345667778523452344234234 and put the rules files from that tarball into the output path of 
/usr/local/etc/snort/rules/ while the -i option tells pulledpork where the
disablesid.conf lives, and the -T option tells pulledpork to not process for any shared object rules and the final
-H option tells pulledpork to send a Hangup signal to the snort pid that you defined in the pulledpork.conf.

./pulledpork.pl -c pulledpork.conf -i disablesid.conf -T -H

Similar to the first example but all options specified in the pulledpork.conf file (other than disablesid and -H)...

./pulledpork.pl -c pulledpork.conf -i disablesid.conf -m /usr/local/etc/snort/sid-msg.map -Hn

The above will simply read the disablesid and disable as defined, then send a Hangup signal after generating the sid-msg.map
at the specified location without downloading anything.
Highly useful when tuning / making changes etc..

Next example, snort inline with rules that we want to drop and disable, then HUP our daemons after creating a sid-msg.map
and writing change info to sid_changes.log!

./pulledpork.pl -c pulledpork.conf -i disablesid.conf -b dropsid.conf -m /usr/local/etc/snort/sid-msg.map \
-h /var/log/sid_changes.log -H

Next example, same as the previous but specifying that we want to run the default "security" based ruleset
and that we want to enable rules specified in enablesid.conf.

./pulledpork.pl -c pulledpork.conf -i disablesid.conf -b dropsid.conf -e enablesid.conf -m /usr/local/etc/snort/sid-msg.map \
-h /var/log/sid_changes.log -I security -H

Next example, same as the previous but specifying that we want to -K (Keep) the originationg tarball names.
and write them to /usr/local/etc/snort/rules/

./pulledpork.pl -c pulledpork.conf -i disablesid.conf -b dropsid.conf -e enablesid.conf -m /usr/local/etc/snort/sid-msg.map \
-h /var/log/sid_changes.log -I security -H -K /usr/local/etc/snort/rules/


** Special Notes Section**
Please note that pulledpork runs rule modification (enable, drop, disable, modify) in that order by default..
1: enable
2: drop
3: disable
This means that disable rules will always take precedence.. thusly if you specify the same gid:sid 
in enable and disable configuration files, then that sid will be disabled.. keep this in mind 
for ranges also!  However, you can specify a different order using the state_order keyword in the
master config file.

I'll probably add more info later, the --help or --? will display all runtime options and the pulledpork.conf is
pretty well annotated... so if you can't figure it out... try harder!  And once you figure it out, please feel 
free to contribute with additional readme / help foo.. thx!

As a side note, I would like to give a shout-out to my buddy Bruce for aiding in the naming of PulledPork!
"hopefully that will shut him up ;-)"
